# Optimal alphabet encoding
## Overview
This paper is the result of several months of work and research conducted for the purpose of completing the course Alati i metode softverskog inzenjerstva i vestacke inteligencije in the master's studies at the Faculty of Organizational Sciences, in the Software Engineering study program.


During the course, I became interested in algorithms and data structures, exploring when to use each one, as well as their performance and data structure organization. In this project, I will present a solution to a problem characteristic of the computer science domain: optimal alphabet coding. I have solved this problem using evolutionary algorithms of artificial intelligence, specifically using a genetic algorithm. This document contains a description of the problem, a brief overview of the algorithms and methodologies used, an outline of the implementation development process, challenges encountered during the work, as well as a review of the solution and a comparison with alternative approaches to solving this problem. Emphasizing the significance of algorithm complexity, I have implemented an approach to solving this problem using a "brute force" method. The solutions are implemented using the Clojure programming language, a dialect of Lisp and belonging to the class of functional programming languages. I encountered this technology during my master's studies.
